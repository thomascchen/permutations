Here's some chill (and a couple not so chill) array functions you can use if you
want.

#Chill Functions:

##arrayGenerator(length)
Creates a sequential array of specified length

##copyArray(array, n)
Creates n clones of array

##deleteAll(array toDelete)
Deletes all occurrences of specified element

##deleteLeftomst(array, toDelete)
Deletes leftmost occurrences of specified element

##deleteRightmost(array, toDelete)
Deletes rightmost occurrences of specified element

##equalArrays(array1, array2)
Returns true if the given 1d or 2d arrays are identical

##factorial(positiveNumber)
Does what you think it does

##flatPush(array1, array2)
Combines all elements of both arrays into a new array

##includes(array, element)
Isn't this supposed to be a core JS Array method? Why does it never work for me
whatevs here's my version

##lastElement(array)
Returns the last element of an array

##permutations(array)
Returns all possible permutations of an array, or crashes node if you give it an
array longer than, like, I don't know, 40

##reverse(array)
I forgot that YavaScript already had reverse so I reimplemented it badly whoops

##rotate(array, n)
Rotate array n degrees e.g. rotate([1, 2, 3], 1) === [3, 1, 2]

##shuffle(array)
Randomly shuffles an arrays elements

##stringify(array)
Converts all the array's elements to strings

##swapElements(array, index1, index2)
Element at index1 trades places with element at index 2. Hilarity ensues.

##uniq(array1)
Returns a copy of 1d or 2d array with all duplicates removed.

#Less chill functions:
There is also some utterly crazy garbage hidden in here if you want to go
looking through the source -- like a function that takes a given array element
and moves it to every possible position in that array, while leaving the rest
of the elements in the same positions relative to each other. Why would you ever
want to do that? Well you could use it in a really terrible implementation of
permutation (which is also in here somewhere)
